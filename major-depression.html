                <p>
                    Major depressive disorder, also called clinical depression, is a condition where an individual experiences persistent and intense feelings of sadness, loss, and despair. In most cases, this negatively affects how one behaves and can make life extremely difficult.
                    <br><br>
                    It is important to remember that depression is not the same as feeling sad after a negative experience. It is a medical condition that affects oneâ€™s life constantly.

                <p>
                    Most people will not experience the exact same symptoms, but common signs of major depression include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emptiness</li>
                        <li>Loss of motivation</li>
                        <li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
                        <li>Loss of sex drive</li>
                        <li>Irritability</li>
                        <li>Fatigue and sleep changes</li>
                        <li>Thoughts of suicide (if you have this symptom, get help immediately)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For most, these symptoms are noticeable enough to cause problems with work, study, sleep, appetite, relationships, and the joy of life.</p>

                <h4>Treatments</h4>
                <p>Major depression is most commonly treated with some combination of medications (antidepressants) and psycotherpapy. Less common treatments include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a procedure where small electric currents are passed through the patient's brain which appears to change chemistry within the brain, treating the symptoms of depression.</p>
