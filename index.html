            <h2>Mood Disorders</h2>
            <p>Mood disorders are psychological conditions that affect both the mental and behavioral state of an individual. Those with mood disorders experience emotions that may be inconsistent with their environment that are so extreme that they may negatively impact one's life. Typically, depressive feelings such as persistent sadness, irritability, or hopelessness and manic feelings like excessive happiness or energy are both signs of a mood disorder. Mood disorder is a broad term that includes many more specific conditions such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia).</p>

            <h3>Causes of Mood Disorders</h3>
            <p>A number of different factors contribute to mood disorders including biological factors, hormones, inherited traits, life events, and early childhood trauma. Many mood disorders may be caused by abnormal levels of chemicals in the brain while other times stressful life changes may hurt one's mental health. Early childhood trauma is also thought to play a role in mood disorders as stressful events during childhood can permanently change the brain. It is also likely that genetics play a role in one's likelihood of developing a mood disorder.</p>

            <h3>Mental Illness Stigma</h3>
            <p>There is a large stigma around mental illnesses in society. Many people think that those suffering from mental illnesses just need to “get over it.” These kinds of stigmas cause those in need of help to keep their problems to themselves because they do not want to appear weak or shameful. Unfortunately, it is very common for people to delay getting medical help for mental conditions that could be making their lives very difficult.</p>
