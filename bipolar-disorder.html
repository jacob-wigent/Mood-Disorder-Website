                <p>
                    Those suffering from bipolar disorder experience drastic mood swings from emotional highs (mania) to emotional lows (depression). The rate at which these swings happen varies from person to person, but they commonly last from weeks to months.
                    <br><br>
                    In the manic state, you may feel euphoric, energetic, or easily irritable and become more talkative or overactive, while in the depressive state, you may feel symptoms such as sadness or hopelessness.
