                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a form of depression triggered by the seasons. Most people with this condition experience depressive moods starting in the fall and throughout winter. These seasonal changes in mood are believed to be connected to changes in light levels and less sun exposure. Circadian rhythms and levels of melatonin and serotonin are also thought to be involved.</p>

                <p>
                    For most people, symptoms begin in the late fall and resolve closer to spring. There are cases, however, where the opposite is true. Regardless, symptoms of seasonal affective disorder include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sadness and listlessness</li>
                        <li>Sluggishness</li>
                        <li>Irritability</li>
                        <li>Carbohydrate cravings and weight gain</li>
                        <li>Oversleeping</li>
                        <li>Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness</li>
                    </ul>

                <h4>Treatments</h4>
                <p>Treatments for seasonal affective disorder include psychotherapy, medications (antidepressants), and light therapy. Light therapy is a treatment where the patient is exposed to light from special light boxes in the mornings. The goal of this is to mimic the natural sunlight which is linked to improved mood in many people. This form of treatment is often used first due to its lack of side effects.</p>
